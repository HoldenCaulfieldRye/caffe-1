Water Contamination High Risk:
confused about all.
ground contact and ground wet?
definition: looking for traces of water (resp soil) on the scrape zones or on the
fitting. 

Water Contamination Risk:
101289.jpg: why not high risk?
107889.jpg: 

Soil Contamination High Risk:
ground contact? (so water risk => soil risk? maybe we should merge
them)

Soil Contamination Low Risk:
ground contact and ground dry?
when weld is barely excavated, semi buried in ground?
155610.jpg: why low risk specifically?


No Visible Evidence of Scraping or Peeling:
100979.jpg: writing to the right, scraped or coincidence?
101259.jpg: left side of clamp not fitted in properly right?
It looks like so many images do not show clear signs of being scraped,
event those without the badScrape flag. To correctly learn scraping,
it seems we would need a set of 1000 handpicked images where scraping
is very clearly visible. net would then become very stringent and ping
the user until he does a close up.
could be strong correlation between hatch markings and visible
evidence of scraping or peeling. verify this numerically
seems we will need a handpicked dataset where scraping peeling is very
much present. Dave agrees.
Besides, Redbox itself does not provide enough info to determine
whether there is scraping, when the pipe is not peelable.


Inadequate Scraping:
hand scraping is ok 


Joint misaligned:
118078.jpg: yeah it's curvy, but does that really matter? looks
decently straight


Fitting proximity:
when two tap-in T joints are too close together
